Comprehensive Analysis of EPL Match Data Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This repository contains the work of our project on analyzing English Premier League (EPL) football matches using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to enhance strategic decision-making and improve game outcomes by exploring the predictive power of machine learning in sports analytics.

Purpose
The project aims to:

Analyze various match-related statistics to determine influential factors on match results, such as team formations, home advantage, and shot efficiency.
Develop predictive models using machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to forecast match outcomes.
Repository Structure
data/: Contains the raw and processed datasets used in our analyses.
docs/: Documentation related to the project and findings.
src/: Source code for the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the exploratory data analysis and model development processes.
results/: Visualizations and output files from our analyses.
Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Using Beautiful Soup for web scraping data from the ‘fbref’ website, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data were explored to understand the impact of football formations, goal differentials, and more.
Hypothesis Testing: Evaluating theories like the influence of higher shot counts on winning games and the statistical significance of 'home advantage'.
Model Development and Validation: Machine learning models were developed and validated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Tools and Technologies
Python: For data scraping, preprocessing, and machine learning.
Beautiful Soup: Used for web scraping.
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
